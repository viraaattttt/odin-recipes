    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Listen, I know chicken nuggets are traditionally known to be kids’ food. THESE nuggets though? Of course kids will love them but when I made these for the first time, they disappeared incredibly quickly and there was not a child in sight. And I mean, what’s not to love? Juicy nuggets of crispy, golden chicken? Uh, yes please! These nuggets are great served simply with ketchup but they’re even better when you add honey mustard sauce to dip as you go.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The traditional process to make dosa starts by soaking rice and lentils, which are later ground to a batter and fermented overnight in a warm place. After a good fermentation, the batter increases in volume, becomes light with plenty of small air pockets and develops a slight tangy flavor.</p>
    <p>The batter is spread like a crepe on a hot griddle/pan known as tawa or dose kallu. It is cooked with a little oil, ghee or butter until crisp. The joy of eating hot crispy dosas with your favorite Coconut Chutney, Potato Masala or Tiffin Sambar is unparalleled. At home we also love these with Aloo Chana kurma</p>

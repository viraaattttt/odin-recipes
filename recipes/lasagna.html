    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna was one of the first dishes I learned to make in college. The early attempts were based on an easy lasagna recipe that kept dishes to a minimum but still provided plenty of leftovers. When I would cook it, the irresistible aroma of melting cheese and robust pasta sauce would waft down the hall. It earned me a reputation as the cook on my floor. Before long, I started doubling the lasagna ingredients to make it in a huge disposable pan—perfect for feeding a crowd or for holiday occasions</p>
    <p>After years of experimentation, I finally landed on the best lasagna recipe. Making the sauce from scratch takes a few more steps than a lazy lasagna made with store-bought sauce and precooked meat. But it’s always worth the effort. The leftovers freeze exceptionally well, too, so don’t be afraid to make an extra pan for later.</p>
    <p>The best part about this lasagna is that many of the steps can be done in advance. Cook the meat sauce a few days ahead, or prepare the entire lasagna ahead of time. It’s one of our favorite make-ahead freezer meals.</p>
